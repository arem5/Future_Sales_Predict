## DATA DESCRIPTION 

*input*        :daily historical sales data and a test set (Note: list of shops and products slightly changes every month)  <br/>
*output*       :total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set  <br/>
  <br/>
*sales_train.csv*         :the training set. Daily historical data from January 2013 to October 2015.  <br/>
*test.csv*                 :the test set. You need to forecast the sales for these shops and products for November 2015.  <br/>
*sample_submission.csv*    :a sample submission file in the correct format.  <br/>
*items.csv*                :supplemental information about the items/products. <br/>
*item_categories.csv*      :supplemental information about the items categories. <br/>
*shops.csv*                :supplemental information about the shops.  <br/>

## DATA EXPLORATION<br/>
<br/>
In the data there ara 33 months between two date and there are 60 shops.We can see the sales performance of all shops on the graphs for 33 months. <br/>
We can see an increase on sales every 12th month. <br/>
<br/>

# TRAIN <br/> 
 <br/>
I compare two method in this project for "Predict Future Sales" . <br/>
1) *Linear* *Regression*  <br/>
2) *Convolution Neural Network* <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can see the predict result in *'result'* folder.  <br/>

<br/>
I make dataset with <br/>
"item_cnt_day" values with the same id are added together and filled substituted 0 for "NaN" values . <br/>
After I have Merged "shop_id" and "item_id" in test and train dataset and have occoured dataset for  
train with "LinearRegression" and "Convolution Neural Network".
